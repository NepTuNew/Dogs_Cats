This repository is a practice for images recognition using cnn network with tensorflow.
Learning the cnn network from Tensorflow101(https://github.com/c1mone/Tensorflow-101) tutorial.
And the reference for TFRecords making is from this note
(http://ycszen.github.io/2016/08/17/TensorFlow%E9%AB%98%E6%95%88%E8%AF%BB%E5%8F%96%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE/).

Datasets are download from the Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/).

Using the Tensorflow open-source software library for machine learning.
